# Sprint Quality Quick Checks

Complete the section for your current sprint at its final class meeting. These are quick evidence checks, not a demand for a perfect product.

## Sprint 0 - Launch and Scope (Week 3)

* [x] Every member can access the repository and board.
* [ ] Meaningful work has an Issue, owner, and Definition of Done.
* [x] The project purpose, target user, and scope boundary are visible.
* [x] The team agreement is linked and current.
* [ ] No personal data, secrets, or unapproved real-user data has been posted.

### Sprint 0 Evidence

**Project purpose:**
SmartServe is a restaurant POS system designed to help restaurant staff manage the core process of selecting menu items, creating orders, processing payments, and updating inventory reliably.

**Target user:**
The primary target users are restaurant staff who need to create and process customer orders efficiently.

**Scope boundary:**
The initial scope focuses on the core order workflow:

> Select menu item → Calculate total and create order with a unique ID → Successful simulated payment → Mark order as paid and deduct inventory once.

The initial Sprint 0 scope does not include real payment gateway integration, advanced restaurant management, loyalty systems, complex reporting, or other features outside the candidate vertical slice.

**Issue evidence:**
The first implementation work is divided into GitHub Issues covering the menu, order/cart flow, order totals, simulated payment, inventory deduction, and order recording.

**Team agreement:**
The [team working agreement](../week-01/team-working-agreement.md) is maintained as part of the project documentation and is used to guide responsibilities and collaboration.

**Linked evidence:** [work checklist](week-03-work-checklist.md), [Sprint 0 report](sprint-0-report.md), [shared Weekly Report](weekly-report.md), and [Issue #3 test results](issue-3-test-results.md). The backend tests and frontend build passed locally; browser and PostgreSQL concurrency verification remain pending. Existing checked boxes reflect the team's submitted checklist and have not been independently reverified here.

**Data and security check:**
The team will use safe demo/sample data during development. No real customer information, passwords, payment information, API keys, or other private credentials should be included in GitHub evidence.

## Sprint 1 - Vertical Slice (Week 7)

* [ ] One small end-to-end user path works or its blocker is clearly documented.
* [ ] The path has a screenshot, demo, or test note.
* [ ] The team can explain what happens when the main path cannot complete.
* [ ] The README or setup note tells another person how to view or run the current work.
* [ ] The team has checked that no secrets or private data are in its shared evidence.

## Sprint 2 - MVP and Freeze (Week 11)

* [ ] The MVP happy path has been tested and recorded.
* [ ] Known bugs are labeled by severity and have an owner or plan.
* [ ] New features are frozen or explicitly justified against the MVP contract.
* [ ] The project has basic input/error handling or a documented limitation.
* [ ] AI-assisted or outside material is reviewed, explainable, and attributed where relevant.

## Sprint 3 - QA and Handoff (Week 14)

* [ ] Main demo path, error/empty state, and key links or buttons have been checked.
* [ ] Keyboard access, visible labels, and readable contrast have received a basic review.
* [ ] Setup and handoff instructions work for someone outside the team.
* [ ] The project has safe demo data and no secrets or private data in shared evidence.
* [ ] Demo fallback and remaining blocker plan are documented.

## Sprint 4 - Final Readiness (Week 15)

* [ ] The final demo has been rehearsed with its fallback plan.
* [ ] Presentation and demo roles are assigned.
* [ ] Final evidence, contribution receipts, setup guide, and handoff links are easy to find.
* [ ] Blocker and major-bug status is honest and current.
* [ ] The Final Readiness Report names any remaining action and owner.
